Analysis for tree:

1.  How long does it take to get to a particular node?  height of the tree

2.  What's the height of a binary tree with N nodes?

Height: 1  2  3  4  5  6    H
Nodes:  1  3  7 15 31 63    2**H - 1
Leaves: 1  2  4  8 16 32    2**(H-1)

So nodes = 2**height - 1  <=>  height = ceiling( log2 (nodes) )

So if height = O(log2 (nodes)), access time = O(log2 (nodes)) = O(log2 n)
